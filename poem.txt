Behold her, single in the field,
Yon solitary Highland Lass!
Reaping and singing by herself;
A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,
Breaking the silence of the seas
Among the farthest Hebrides.adding data as listadding to the end of the lineadding data as listadding to the end of the lineadding data as listadding to the end of the lineadding data as listadding to the end of the lineadding data as listadding to the end of the lineusing flushfn to add the data in the buffer to the text fileIndiastudying python
